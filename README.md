# Areal Prediction Framework

An automated framework for downloading raster data and acquisition dates from WMS servers or geoportals, followed by prediction the mask over the WMS tiles using a UNet model.

## Description

This repository integrates two submodules:

1. **[Data Acquisition](https://github.com/LUP-LuftbildUmweltPlanung/Data_acquisition):** This module contains Python scripts to download image data and their corresponding acquisition dates from specified WMS servers or geoportals using one or more shapefiles.

2. **[UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597):** This module provides the code necessary to run a UNet model, based on the Dynamic UNet implementation from fastai, utilizing the PyTorch Deep Learning framework. The UNet model is used for image segmentation (pixel-wise classification).

   
* Finally the output will be three different folders: **"WMS_tiles", "Meta_files", "Predicted tiles"**.
Or if merged defined as True, the output beside the folder three different files too:  **"WMS_merged.tif", "Meta_merged.tif", "Predicted_merged.tif"**.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- GDAL
- PyTorch-Fastai
- SciPy
- CUDA-capable GPU ([CUDA GPUs Overview](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus))
- Anaconda ([Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution))

**Note:** This project was developed on Windows 10.

### Installation
To use the UNet model for prediction processing, follow these installation steps:
#### Installation for (UNet)
```bash
conda create --name Areal_predict_unet python=3.9.6

conda activate Areal_predict_unet

cd ../Areal_prediction_framework/environment

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you want to use SAM2 for predicting tiles, follow these steps for installation:

#### Installation for SAM2
```bash
# 1. Create and activate the Conda environment
conda create -n Areal_predict_sam2_1 python=3.11
conda activate Areal_predict_sam2_1

# 2. Install PyTorch and its dependencies
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# 3. Go to the main folder where the script is located
cd ../Areal_prediction_framework

# 4. Clone the SAM2 repository and rename the folder to avoid conflicts
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git
mv sam2 sam2_conf

# 5. Change into the 'sam2_conf' directory and copy the 'sam2' folder to the 'sam2_1_fine_tune-main' folder
cd sam2_conf
cp -r sam2 ../sam2/

# 6. Install the SAM2 package in editable mode
pip install -e .

# 7. Navigate to the 'checkpoints' folder and download model checkpoints
cd checkpoints && download_ckpts.sh
cd ../..
cd checkpoints_sam2 && download_ckpts.sh

# 8. Go two directories up and install additional dependencies
cd environment
pip install -r requirements_sam2.txt
```
## Executing the Program

Set the desired parameters in `Areal_predict.py` and run the script.
