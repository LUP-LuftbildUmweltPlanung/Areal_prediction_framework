# Areal Prediction Framework

An automated framework for downloading raster data and acquisition dates from WMS servers or geoportals, followed by prediction the mask over the WMS tiles using a UNet model.

## Description

This repository integrates two submodules:

1. **[Data Acquisition](https://github.com/LUP-LuftbildUmweltPlanung/Data_acquisition):** This module contains Python scripts to download image data and their corresponding acquisition dates from specified WMS servers or geoportals using one or more shapefiles.

2. **[UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597):** This module provides the code necessary to run a UNet model, based on the Dynamic UNet implementation from fastai, utilizing the PyTorch Deep Learning framework. The UNet model is used for image segmentation (pixel-wise classification).

   
* Finally the output will be three different folders: **"WMS_tiles", "Meta_files", "Predicted tiles"**.
Or if merged defined as True, the output beside the folder three different files too:  **"WMS_merged.tif", "Meta_merged.tif", "Predicted_merged.tif"**.
